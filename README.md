# 50-Projects-in-2023
This Repository contains 50 different projects I will be taking on in the year 2023. They will conatin diffent projects which can span across several programming languages/stacks, varying from Front-End(Web Development tools - HTML5, CSS3 and Javacsript), Python, Java and Android.
It is going to be an interesting and tasking journey. However, I hope to have fun, develop my skills and make progress with each project. So yeah, in the words of the famous Football Transfer journalist, Fabrizio Romano, "HERE WE GO!!".
